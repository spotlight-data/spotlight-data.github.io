	      <h2>Our methods in more detail</h2>
	      <p class="w3-text-grey">
          &emsp;Based on a meeting with the city of Berkeley IT department and research on government open data policies we determined five key categories that we could use to compare the open data platforms of different local governments in the Bay Area — quantity, recency, accessibility, breadth and quality.
        </p>
        <p class="w3-text-grey">
          &emsp;To select the cities to compare, we decided to focus on the governments which use Socrata. Socrata is a software company which many cities use to power their open data platforms, including San Francisco and Oakland. Next, we considered various statistics we could collect about each city’s data platform, and how these could inform our metrics. 
        </p>
        <p class="w3-text-grey">
          &emsp;Having decided on a set of cities and metrics by which to assess them, we built a collection of web-scraping algorithms. These deterministically searched from the navigation page of an open data platform, “clicking” every possible link and checking to see if the link fulfills the “dataset” criterion. We applied Regular Expressions (RegEx) on each webpage’s source code and link to guide the scraper’s search. 
        </p>
        <p class="w3-text-grey">
          &emsp;Once we had a list of links to the datasets published by each city, we were able to extract more information from the corresponding JSON (Javascript Object Notation) files. Our scripts extracted relevant information from the metadata section of each file, such as view count and recency. 
        </p>
        <p class="w3-text-grey">
          &emsp;Finally, we organized these statistics by city and dataset and wrote our results to files for further analysis. We discuss our  analytical methods below.

</h5>

	      <p class="w3-text-grey">The number of datasets, parsed from the html of data platform web page, varies from source to source, since each source had a different consideration about what it considered datasets.</p>
        <p class="w3-text-grey">For example, some numbers included data visualizations and maps. In order to mitigate this and disallow for double counting, all of the quantity numbers were extracted from pages similar to <a class="w3-hover-white" href="https://data.sfgov.org/browse?limitTo=datasets&utf8">this page</a> on San Francisco’s list of datasets. This filters all of the results to simply the datasets.</p>

              &emsp;Project Open Data was founded in the second Obama administration to provide tools for data transparency and accountability for federal agencies. Their website offers a tool for JSON validation, which examines the metadata of a file to see if it is in accordance with federal standards. We evaluated data files for 6 cities in the Bay Area, checking against the Non-Federal Scheme version 1.1. We found that none of the cities passed the test.
            </p>
            <p class="w3-text-grey">&emsp;Interestingly, the error results for these 6 cities were identical (with the exception of dataset length). What all of these cities have in common is that their open data platforms are powered by Socrata. From this we conclude that while Socrata enforces a JSON metadata format for all datasets in its open data portals, this format has serious errors and does not meet federal government standards, even for non-federal government.
